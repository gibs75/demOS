Releases <BR>

* RC7 - released at Sommarhack convention 4th July 2015

  Add data precache feature: 
  if you have at least 2mb of RAM but only 1 floppy drive you can now run Rebirth
	
  maybe it can also solve problems for people having floppy timing problems <BR>
  => in this case just keep your second floppy drive switched off <BR>
  => if you run Rebirth with the 2 floppy drives switched on, it will load as before 
   (without precache) <BR>

TODO <BR>
* add CRC / RNF error management in FDC routine
